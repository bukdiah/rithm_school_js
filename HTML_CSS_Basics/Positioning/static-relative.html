<!--
    positioning let's us take an element on the page and control where and how it's positioned relative to things
    such as its original starting position, other elements, or even the window itself. Depending on the type, the element
    will either remain in the document flow (relative) or be removed from the document flow (absolute, fixed) like with floats

    Once position is defined, we can use offset values for top, right, bottom, left, and z-index

    BY DEFAULT, the POSITION of an element is STATIC.

    STATIC vs RELATIVE: A static element IGNORES all offet properties. Other than that, they are the same.
